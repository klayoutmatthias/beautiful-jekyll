# Glyphs

This example demonstrates how to use the `TextGenerator` class. See here
for the [original documentation](https://www.klayout.de/doc-qt5/code/class_TextGenerator.html).

It also shows how to use a custom font. The font is defined by a special GDS 
file ([Download `7seg_font.gds`](7seg_font.gds)).

Code:

```python
{% include_relative glyphs/glyphs.py %}
```

Result:

![Result](glyphs.png)
