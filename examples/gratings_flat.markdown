# Flat Gratings

This example generates three different gratings with 
identical bar widths but different pitches.

The gratings are created "flat", i.e. by iterating
the coordinates and creating a box for each line.

Code:

```python
{% include_relative gratings_flat/gratings_flat.py %}
```

Result:
